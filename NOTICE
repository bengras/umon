   Micromonitor Embedded System Boot Monitor

   This package contains code primarily developed at
   Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent Technologies
   (http:http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/).

   This software contains code derived from the Freebsd project
   (https://www.freebsd.org/).

   The compression/decomppresion support is provided by the Zlib
   project (www.zlib.net). 

   Some files from both Freebsd and Zlib have been modified
   to build in the Micromonitor environment.

   Some port/cpu/device-specific files are from Mike Kelly
   Cogent Computer Systems (http://www.cogcomp.com).

   An SMC ethernet driver from Jay Monkman
   (www.lopingdog.com).

   Some improvements to original JFFS2 code from Bill Gatliff
   (www.billgatliff.com).
