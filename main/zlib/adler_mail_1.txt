No there is no problem, you can distribute it directly.  You must not
misrepresent the origin of the source.  If you have modified the zlib
sources at all, then you have to mark them as such and include that
in the ChangeLog.

I recommend that you include a reference to the zlib web site so that
users can if they wish get the latest version.
