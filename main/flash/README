devices:
	Each .c file represents one configuration of one particular flash
	device.  These files can be used standalone or mixed, depending on
	the configuration of the board.  Refer to devices/README for full
	details.
	Not all driver files have been updated to conform with uMon1.0.
	The easiest way to determine if the driver has been updated to 
	uMon1.0 is to look at the relocatable xxx_lock() function.  If
	it supports the FLASH_LOCKABLE operation properly, then it has
	been updated to be uMon1.0 compatible.

Note that several of these drivers may need updating.
Especially notable is the need for the WATCHDOG_MACRO to be inserted
in strategic points within the driver.  Obviously this will only be
needed if the hardware runs with a watchdog.
