then you can refer to the OLD_TO_NEW.txt file for steps on how to
convert the makefile.

Refer to the text in the makefile for detailed information on the
structure of the makefile.

Refer to reset.s for basic bootup (assembler) initialization.
Refer to cpuio.c for port-specific 'C' level startup functions.
